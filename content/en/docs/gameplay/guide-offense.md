[Glossary](../guide-quick#glossary)

Everything you do relies on timing with your `Capper`. Since the `Capper` looks to move the enemy flag, your goal is to kill everything that can prevent `Capper` from escaping successfully.

If you hear `E-Grab` you should prioritize performing/supporting an `E-Grab` unless your capper will beat them. 

#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill the enemy `Heavy on Flag` and enemy `Light Defense` `5 seconds` before your `Capper` will grab.
- Put pressure on the enemy `Sniper` to prevent them from killing your `Capper` pre-grab and post-grab. Generally, only 1 `Offense` member does this, and only if you are running 1 `Capper`
- `E-Grab` when the `Defense` calls for it.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- <kbd>K</kbd>-Out and meet your Capper after they grab.
- Hit the enemy stand at the same time as other `Offense` members, aim for when your `Capper` would be `15 seconds` out. 
- Spot enemy `Cappers` and enemy `Offense`, this assists your `Defense` better than you shooting the enemy `Offense`.
- `Walk` flags with your other `Offense` members.

## Timing
Your goal is to kill every enemy near their stand when your `Capper` is `5 seconds` out. As respawns are 5 seconds, they will not be able to do anything to prevent your `Capper` from grabbing the flag successfully.

Generally speaking, getting to the enemy stand when your `Capper` is `15 seconds` out is optimal. This will provide you with enough time to put damage on the enemies `HOF` and `LD` or `MD`

Capping routes generally take between `25 seconds` and `50 seconds`. If the routes have been too fast for you to keep up, ask your `Capper` to wait before leaving so you can get to the stand on time. On most maps, you should be able to get to the enemy stand on a `35+ seconds` route consistently at the `15 second` time call. 

As long as your fellow `Offense` members hit at the same time you should be able to output significant disruption on the enemy. 

### When to reset

Using the <kbd>K</kbd> key to reset is effective to keep yourself in sync with your `Capper` and other `Offense` members.

This should be done just after your `Capper` dies or grabs successfully. Although, if you are in the range of killing/distracting the enemy `Sniper` before they can output exit damage on your `Capper`, disrupting them takes priority. 

There must be no requirement for an `E-Grab` to reset.

You shouldn't `Reset` if performing a `Walk` is optimal. 

Resetting should still be done if you are currently fighting an enemy other than the `Sniper`. It is more beneficial to be on time with your team than getting the kill. 

`Defense` can punish `Offense` that linger around at the enemy base and forcing them to be out of time with their `Capper`.

## Walks
A walk is where an `Offense` member chooses to grab the flag rather than the `Capper`.

Walks can punish `HOFs` that play passively. These `HOFs` focus on just killing `Cappers` and avoiding damage.

This also punishes `Snipers` who sit far away from their stand and don't work with their `Light Defense`.

Most of the time you would only walk if your `Capper` dies and the stand is clear enough to get away with a `Walk`. On maps like `Dangerous Crossing` `Walking` when the enemy `HOF` is distracted can be effective even when your capper is still 15 seconds out. 

`Walks` shouldn't be done if your health is low as an `Offense` member. `Walking` is useful if you have other `Offense` members to help protect or promptly meet you. If your fellow `Offense` member is `Walking` the flag it is important to promptly assist in getting the flag back to your base. Respawning as a `Light` class to assist with the walk if you are about to respawn is optimal. 

Due to the `Rage` mechanic, it is generally better to kill the enemy `HOF` and `LD` or `MD` before a walk occurs so they don't regenerate health or energy.

## Spotting
To support your `Defense` effectively an `Offense` member should attempt to spot the enemy `Capper` whenever possible.

Using the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key will spot enemies so that other players can see where the enemy is.

You will need to communicate the side an enemy is from your `Defenses` point of view. 

As an example, if you are on the left side of the map and see an enemy `Capper` moving to your left, you can say "Enemy `Capper` is on the left side". Calling out the name of the player is beneficial to assist `Defense` at determining if the enemy is running multiple cappers or not.

This is where learning routes as an `Offense` member can be advantageous because you can learn the specifics of recognizable routes. This knowledge provides the ability to give time estimates as well as give specific route descriptions. See the [Capper Guide](guide-cap) for more information.

Spotting enemy `Offense` members also assist `Defense`. Allowing your `LD` or `MD` to venture out and kill them before they reach your stand, ruining their timing. 

## Sniper Pressure
Killing the enemy `Sniper` before your `Capper` has regenerated their health is an important objective pre-flag grab. 

A `Sniper` can easily shut down a `Capper` if they find them on their route with low hit points. 

Killing the enemy `Sniper` before your `Capper` starts a route can prevent them from spotting your `Capper` as they start, adding more pressure. 

### Spawn Mechanics
Spawns are weighted on some maps and some are more beneficial to an enemy `Sniper` than others.

`Arx Novena` on the `Blood Eagle` side is a great example of this. The left/sniper hill spawn can be extremely useful for the enemy `Sniper` to get exit damage on your `Cappers` if your `Capper` was on a `Left to Right` route. This is also a useful spawn for `Snipers` to pre-snipe your capper before they regenerate their health on the common `Back to Front` route. 

If you've recently killed an enemy `Sniper`, sitting directly on the spawn location can prevent them from spawning at that location.

By standing a short distance away from the spawn, allows an enemy to spawn at that location. This is an effective way to repeatedly kill an enemy `Sniper`.

The `Sniper` has a longer respawn time than all other classes in the game. `10 seconds` rather than `5 seconds`.

### How to play Flex
The `Flex` role is assigned to an `Offense` member that knows how to run capping routes. This is generally a role dedicated to disrupting the enemy `Sniper`. Two `Cappers` can be harder to spot and shut down than one. 

This member will run routes that grab at the same time as the other `Capper`, as well as disrupt/kill the enemy sniper on other runs. 

Choosing if they should run two cappers or a disruptor tends to be down to how the game plays out. Some `Snipers` do well against multiple `Cappers`. This works effectively on maps that are harder to spot enemy `Cappers` from the stand like the map `Katabatic`.

Another benefit of playing `Flex` is you don't have to always try to grab the flag. You can choose to attack the stand or `Sniper` if your route gets spotted early or your health regeneration has been shut down for the route.

## Classes
Most of the time it is best to be a `Medium` or a `Heavy` on `Offense`. `Brute`, `Juggernaut`, `Raider` and `Soldier` are the main `GOTY` `Offense` classes.

Having an explosive or timed weapon and a chain or hitscan weapon is optimal for all `Offense` classes. `Juggernauts` can run `Spinfusor Discs` as their explosive weapon opening up a `Mortar` and chain/hitscan combination.
