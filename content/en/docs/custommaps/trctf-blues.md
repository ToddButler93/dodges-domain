![Blues](/img/maps/blues-bases.png)

## Description 
Two hills, valley, long bounding hills, ultra smooth terrain. Very much a standard formula for a decent tribes map. Not too many bells or whistles but the rocks are easy to bounce off. Set on a grassy moon surrounded by pools of water with remnants of the past Tribes structures.

## Features
Line of site blocking. Shit should be in all tribes maps. Avoiding the spotting of spawns from the opposing stand and spawns.

## Restrictions
![Blues Birdseye](/img/maps/blues-birdseye.png)

This map is aimed primarily for organised play.
As competitive viability is important for this map, all assets and terrain shall be mirrored to avoid advantage for either side.
As this was my first map, I used a lot of assets in the base game as placeholders. The intention is to add completely custom assets to all my maps.

## Capping
