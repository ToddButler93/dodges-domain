# Quick PUG Guide
## 7v7 Format
`Pick Up Games` are a semi-competitive 7v7 format. Games are usually organized via Mumble or Discord.

Each team runs 4 `Offense` and 3 `Defense` for both standard play and `Stand-Offs`

Generally speaking, the `Defense` consists of a `Heavy On Flag`, a `Light Defense`/`Medium Defense`, and a `Sniper`

The `Offense` have two recommended setups:
- 3 `Offense` members and a `Capper` with one `Offense` member going after the enemy `Sniper`
- 2 `Offense` members and 2 `Cappers`

Usually `Defense` goes `Defense` during `Stand Offs` and `Offense` goes `Offense` during `Sand-Offs`

### Recommendations
These are PUG-specific recommendations to make the game more enjoyable for everyone involved. These are not rules but are heavily frowned upon.
- If both flags are home, if you are an `Offense` or `Capper` there is little to no gain in killing/shooting enemy `Offense`. If `Defense` is struggling, spotting enemy `Capper` is substantially more beneficial.
- Running 4+ `Defense` members generally makes games slow and boring for both teams. 
- Try to run a `Capper` that does not warp. 

## Roles
### Offense

[Offense Guide](guide-offense.md)

#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill the enemy `Heavy on Flag` and enemy `Light Defense` `5 seconds` before your `Capper` will grab.
- Put pressure on the enemy `Sniper` to prevent them from killing your `Capper` pre-grab and post-grab. Generally, only 1 `Offense` member does this, and only if you are running 1 `Capper`
- `E-Grab` when the `Defense` calls for it.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- <kbd>K</kbd>-Out and meet your Capper after they grab.
- Hit the enemy stand at the same time as other `Offense` members, aim for when your `Capper` would be `15 seconds` out. 
- Spot enemy `Cappers` and enemy `Offense`, this assists your `Defense` better than you shooting the enemy `Offense`.
- `Walk` flags with your other `Offense` members.

### Heavy on Flag
<!--[Heavy on Flag Guide](guide-hof.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Stop the enemy `Capper`
- Stop enemy `Walks`
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Be ready to stop unspotted/out of time grabs.
- Work with the `Light Defense` to get kills on enemy `Offense` without overextending yourself.
- Only leave the stand during a `Stand-Off`
- Avoid being shot if possible.

### Light/Medium Defense
<!--[Light/Medium Defense Guide](guide-defense.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill enemy `Offense`
- Return flags.
- Call out for `E-Grabs`
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Work with the `Sniper`
- Call out enemy `Offense` you are shooting so the `Sniper` and `Heavy On Flag` know who to shoot.
- If the enemy `Capper` has recently died, assist any walks your `Offense` may be doing or meet your `Capper`.

### Sniper
<!--[Sniper Guide](guide-snipe.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Spot/kill the enemy `Capper` at all times.
- Call out a time and direction the enemy cap will be.
- Call out for `E-Grabs`.
- Snipe the enemy `Offense` which your `Light Defense` and `Heavy on Flag` are fighting or during any walk attempts. 
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Call out enemy `Offense` locations.
- Assist `Heavy On Flag` with clearing your base if over-run after an enemy has grabbed.
- Avoid enemy `Offense`.
- Snipe the enemy chaser if your `Capper` is out.

### Capper

[Capper Guide](guide-cap.md)

#### Major Responsibilities
- Grab and capture the enemy flag.
- Communicate times on your route for your `Offense` members.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Meet your `Offense` if they decide to `Walk` the flag.
- Wait in case your `Offense` needs more time to get to the stand.

## Stand-Offs

- Usually `Offense` is the `Offense` and `Defense` is the `Defense`

- It is more beneficial for your team to go `Offense` if there are 3 players already on `Defense`. Setting this up promptly is super beneficial.

- `Defense` during standoffs generally should be Mediums for the maneuverability but having a heavy can be quite strong as well.

- Staying near your spawns as `Defense` is very important. 

- Various class compositions amongst `Offense` each have their own benefits and drawbacks. Running 3+ Light classes on `Offense` can easily be shut down whereas a broad spectrum of classes can be effective. 

- `Offense` should coordinate times for hitting the enemy `Defense` together. Generally done off the game time or every 5-second countdown.

## Loadout Setup
For all classes except for the `Sniper`, it is considered optimal to run at least one explosive/timed weapon and at least one chain/hit-scan weapon.

For `Custom Servers`, you must be a verified user for your load-outs to save.
