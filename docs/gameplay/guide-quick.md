# Quick PUG Guide
## 7v7 Format
`Pick-up Games` are a semi-competitive 7v7 format. Pick-up games will use VoIP software such as Mumble or Discord.

Each team runs 4 `offense` and 3 `defense`.

Generally speaking, the `defense` consists of a `HOF,` a `light defense`/`medium defense,` and a `sniper.`

`Offense` have two recommended setups:
- 3 `offense` members and a `capper` with one `offense` member going after the enemy `Sniper`
- 2 `offense` members and 2 `cappers`

`Defense` goes `defense` during `stand-offs` and `offense` goes `offense` during `stand-offs.`

### Recommendations
These are PUG-specific recommendations to make the game more enjoyable for everyone involved. These are not rules but a list of recommendations to improve the flow and make you a more effective member of your team.
- If both flags are home, if you are an `offense` member or a `capper,` there is little to no gain in killing/shooting enemy `offense.` If `defense` is struggling, spotting enemy `capper` is substantially more beneficial.
- Running 4+ `defense` members generally makes games slow for both teams. 
- Try to run a `capper` that does not warp. 

## Roles
### Offense

[Offense Guide](guide-offense.md)

#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill the enemy `heavy on flag` and enemy `light defense` `5 seconds` before your `capper` will grab.
- Put pressure on the enemy `Sniper` to prevent them from killing your `capper` pre-grab and post-grab. Generally, only 1 `offense` member does this only if your team is running 1 `capper.`
- `E-Grab` when the `defense` calls for it.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- <kbd>K</kbd>-Out and meet your capper after they grab.
- Hit the enemy stand at the same time as other `offense` members, aim for when your `capper` would be `15 seconds` out. 
- Spot enemy `cappers` and enemy `offense.` This assists your `defense` better than you shooting the enemy `offense.
- `Walk` flags with your other `offense` members.

### Heavy on Flag
<!--[Heavy on Flag Guide](guide-hof.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Stop the enemy `capper.`
- Stop enemy `walks.`
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Be ready to stop unspotted/out of time grabs.
- Work with the `light defense` to get kills on enemy `offense` without overextending yourself.
- Only leave the stand during a `stand-off.`
- Avoid being shot if possible.

### light/medium defense
<!--[light/medium defense Guide](guide-defense.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill enemy the `offense` members.
- Return flags.
- Call out for `E-Grabs`
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Work with the `Sniper`
- Call out enemy `offense` you are shooting so the `Sniper` and `heavy on flag` know who to shoot.
- If the enemy `capper` has recently died, assist any walks your `offense` may be doing or meet your `capper.`

### Sniper
<!--[Sniper Guide](guide-snipe.md)-->
#### Major Responsibilities
- Spot/kill the enemy `capper` at all times.
- Call out a time and direction the enemy cap will be.
- Call out for `E-Grabs`
- Snipe the enemy `offense` which your `light defense` and `heavy on flag` are fighting or during any walk attempts. 
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Call out enemy `offense` locations.
- Assist `heavy on flag` with clearing your base if over-run after an enemy has grabbed.
- Avoid enemy `offense` members.
- Snipe the enemy chaser if your `capper` is out.

### Capper

[Capper Guide](guide-cap.md)

#### Major Responsibilities
- Grab and capture the enemy flag.
- Communicate times on your route for your `offense` members.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- Meet your `offense` if they decide to `Walk` the flag.
- Wait in case your `offense` needs more time to get to the stand.

## Stand-Offs

- `Offense` stays on `offense.`

- `Defense` stays on `defense.`

- It is more beneficial for your team to promptly go `offense` while your team has three members already on `defense.`

- `Defense` generally picks the medium class for maneuverability. Having a heavy can be effective as well.

- Stay near your spawns as `defense.`

- Various class compositions amongst `offense` each have their benefits and drawbacks. Running 3+ light classes on `offense` can be shut down while a broad spectrum of classes can be effective. 

- `Offense` should coordinate times for hitting the enemy `defense` together. The game timer is effective at coordinating a time to attack.

## Loadout Setup
For all classes except for the `sniper,` it is considered optimal to run at least one explosive/timed weapon and at least one chain/hit-scan weapon.

In a `community server,` you must be a verified user for your Loadouts to save.
