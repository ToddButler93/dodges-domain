## Gaining Speed
### Real Basics

- Right-click makes you use your jetpack which sends you up.
- Space lets you ski on the ground with no friction.
- Shooting yourself can be useful to gain momentum. 
- Thrusting makes you go forward off the starting line.
- Angles of the slope you are or about to be on matter. 
- There is a skiing tutorial in-game.
- Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center.

### Slightly less basic, basics

- Jetting while you are heading towards the ground is bad for your speed but missing the next hill is worse.
- Jetting while going up an upwards slope can preserve a lot of your momentum compared to just skiing.
- Jetting while hitting the ground can help you avoid damage.
- Holding a directional key can adjust where you are going and help you slow down.
- Jetting while holding a directional key can help you go higher.
- The faster you are, the harder it is to control where you go.

### How do cappers consistently grab the flag fast?
- [Routes](how-to-cap#show-me-some-routes), learn them. 

### How do cappers change direction so abruptly? 
- Rock bounces which can take many hours to learn to very little time to learn.
- You can bounce off rocks as long as you aren't using jets. 
- Some of these routes are significantly more consistent with a Jump(without jets) bind.
- A lot of these bounces can be a lot easier if you have a mentor to explain the specifics of one bounce.

### How to be the best capper ever
- Learn consistent low visibility routes for all maps.
- Learn how to duel.
- Sync with other cappers and your offence.
- Learn from someone who can cap rather than learning from sDodge.

## Communicate efficiently and effectively.
Communication allows your teammates to clear the enemy defense allowing you to grab.

Learning time calls for your routes is incredibly important. Calling times every 5 seconds is a good rule of thumb to make sure your teammates know when to hit the stand or snipe.
## Returning home
- Minimizing return time is the best thing you can do to secure the cap.
- Grabbing flags at 320+ sanics is optimal. 
- Avoid self-damage here as that will impact your survivability. 
- Going to wherever your teammates are may be more optimal than your stand if it is over-run.

## Rock Bounces
Endgame capping. This is where the boys become men and girls become women.

- Again, don't jet before/while hitting the rock.
- 

## Show me some routes
This site has some map sepcific guides which contain information on specific maps. But many people have pushed out a lot of interesting routes on their respective channels. A lot of the pathfinder GOTY routes work for Parting Gifts/OOTB but may need adjusting.

## TAMods to the rescue
TAMods has a route library that will soon include routes for all maps. Currently missing quite a few and some are only for specific sides. Using the F1 menu and selecting routes for your team is the way to go. 

- Any X spot is where you need a self impulse so you should start the throw of your nitron before the spot. 
- You can cycle through the routes for your current map.
