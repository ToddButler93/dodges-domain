# How to Play Offense

[Glossary](guide-quick#glossary)

Everything you do relies on timing with your `Capper`. Since the `Capper` looks to move the enemy flag, your goal is to kill everything that can prevent `Capper` from escaping successfully.

If you hear `E-Grab` you should prioritize performing/supporting an `E-Grab` unless your capper will beat them. 

#### Major Responsibilities
- Kill the enemy `Heavy on Flag` and enemy `Light Defense` `5 seconds` before your `Capper` will grab.
- Put pressure on the enemy `Sniper` to prevent them from killing your `Capper` pre-grab and post-grab. Generally, only 1 `Offense` member does this, and only if you are running 1 `Capper`
- `E-Grab` when the `Defense` calls for it.
#### Minor Responsibilities
- <kbd>K</kbd>-Out and meet your Capper after they grab.
- Hit the enemy stand at the same time as other `Offense` members, aim for when your `Capper` would be `15 seconds` out. 
- Spot enemy `Cappers` and enemy `Offense`, this assists your `Defense` better than you shooting the enemy `Offense`.
- `Walk` flags with your other `Offense` members.

## Timing
Your goal is to kill every enemy near their stand when your `Capper` is `5 seconds` out. As respawns are 5 seconds, they will not be able to do anything to stop your capper home.

Generally speaking, getting to the enemy stand when your `Capper` is `15 seconds` out is optimal. This will provide you with enough time to put damage on the enemy `Heavy on Flag` and `Light Defense`.

Capping routes generally take between `25 seconds` and `50 seconds`. Asking your `Capper` to wait before leaving so you hit the stand on time is a great idea. If the routes have been too fast for you to keep up. On most maps, you should be able to get to the enemy stand on a `35+ seconds` route consistently at the `15 second` time call. 

As long as your fellow `Offense` members hit at the same time you should be able to output significant disruption on the enemy. 

### When to reset

Using the <kbd>K</kbd> key to reset and time up is extremely important to keep in sync with your `Capper` and other `Offense` members.

The best time to reset to be in sync with your team is just after your `Capper` dies or grabs successfully. This shouldn't be done if you are in the range of killing/distracting the enemy `Sniper` before they can put damage on your `Capper`. 

There must be no requirement for an `E-Grab` to reset.

You shouldn't `Reset` if performing a `Walk` is optimal. 

Resetting should still be done if you are currently fighting an enemy `HOF`. It is more beneficial to be on time than getting the kill. 

`Defense` can hard punish `Offense` that stick around at the enemy base by killing them to make them out of time with their `Capper`.

## Walks
A walk is where an `Offense` member chooses to grab the flag rather than the `Capper`.

Walks are a great way to punish `HOFs` that play super passively. These `HOFs` focus on just killing `Cappers` and avoiding damage.

This is also a great way to punish `Snipers` who sit far away from the stand and don't work with their `Light Defense`.

Most of the time you would only walk if your `Capper` dies and the stand is clear enough to get away with a walk. On maps like `Dangerous Crossing` walking when the enemy `HOF` isn't looking can be extremely effective even when your capper is still 15 seconds out. 

Walks are only a good decision when you have most of your health as an `Offense` member. Generally only useful if you have other `Offense` to help protect and promptly meet you. If your fellow `Offense` member is walking it is incredibly important to meet and assist with getting the flag back to your base. Even can be beneficial to respawn as a `Light` class to meet them and move the flag faster. 

Due to `Rage` mechanics, it is generally better to kill the enemy `HOF` and `LD`/`MD` before a walk occurs so they don't regenerate health or energy.

## Spotting
The most beneficial thing an `Offense` member can do for their `Defense` is spot where the enemy `Capper` is.

Using the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key will spot enemies in the game so that other players can see where the enemy is.

You will need to communicate the side an enemy is from your `Defenses` point of view. So if you are on the left side of the map and see an enemy `Capper` on the left of you, you would say "Enemy `Capper` is on the left side". Calling out the name of the player can also be helpful to determine if the enemy is running multiple cappers or not.

This is where learning routes as an `Offense` member can be extremely beneficial because you can learn if a certain route is a back cap or not. As well as time estimates for the route a player might be on. See the [Capper Guide](how-to-cap) for more information.

Spotting enemy `Offense` can assist your `Defense` on top of the enemy `Cappers`. Allowing your `LD`/`MD` to venture out and kill them before they reach your stand. Messing up the enemy `Offense` timing.

## Sniper Pressure
Killing the enemy `Sniper` before your `Capper` has regenerated their health is an important objective pre-flag grab. A `Sniper` can easily shut down a `Capper` if they find them on their route with low hit points. Killing the enemy `Sniper` before your `Capper` starts a route can prevent them from spotting your `Capper` as they start, adding more pressure. 

### Spawn Mechanics
Spawns are weighted on some maps and some are more beneficial to an enemy `Sniper` than others.

`Arx Novena` on the `Blood Eagle` is a great example of this. The left/sniper hill spawn can be extremely useful to get exit damage on your `Cappers` if your `Capper` was on a `Left to Right` route. Also is a useful spawn for `Snipers` to pre-snipe your capper before they regenerate their health on a `Back to Front` route. If you've recently killed an enemy `Sniper`, sitting directly on the spawn location can prevent them from spawning at that location.

Knowing this, and learning where enemies are likely to spawn can allow you to kill the enemy `Sniper` just after they spawn by standing a short distance from the spawn. This allows for the possibility for them to spawn at that location so you can kill them again. This is great as the `Sniper` has a longer respawn time than all other classes in the game (10 seconds).

### How to play Flex
The `Flex` role is assigned to an `Offense` member that knows how to run some capping routes. This is generally a role dedicated to disrupting the enemy `Sniper`. Two `Cappers` can be harder to spot and shut down than one. 

This member generally will run routes that grab at the same time as the other `Capper`, as well as disrupt/kill the enemy sniper on other runs. This can be difficult to defend against.

Choosing if they should run two cappers or a disruptor tends to be down to how the game plays out. Some `Snipers` do well against multiple `Cappers`. Usually, it is beneficial to run two `Cappers` on maps that are harder to spot enemy `Cappers` from the stand like the map `Katabatic`.

Another benefit of playing flex is you don't have to always try to grab the flag. You can choose to attack the stand or `Sniper` if your route gets spotted early or your health regeneration has been shut down for the route.

## Classes
Most of the time it is best to be a `Medium` or a `Heavy` on `Offense`. `Brute`, `Juggernaut`, `Raider` and `Soldier` are the main `GOTY` `Offense` classes.

Having an explosive or timed weapon and a chain or hitscan weapon is optimal for all `Offense` classes. `Juggernauts` can run `Spinfusor Discs` as their explosive weapon opening up a `Mortar` and chain combo.
