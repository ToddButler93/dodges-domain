## Installing the Game

### Step 1
Download the game from steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17080/Tribes_Ascend/).

### Step 2
Download the latest Tribes Launcher [here](https://github.com/mcoot/TribesLauncherSharp/releases). TAMods has a website to help guide people [here](https://www.tamods.org/docs/doc_user_install.html).

You need [Microsoft Visual C++ redistributes](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/) if you don't have them already installed.
### Step 3
In the launcher, select the Community login server, login and inject TAMods.

Once injected, the Play Now button will show whether you are in OOTB or GOTY mode. There is a button on the main menu to switch. You need to be in GOTY mode to play on GOTY servers and OOTB mode to play on OOTB servers.

## Playing Custom Maps on the Official Game

You can only play custom maps on the community login server.

### Step 1 

Download the [TA Package Files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u_nItIPxeA79Im8tXgg3Q41RS2iBAT_O/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it into your "\Tribes\TribesGame\CookedPC\Maps\" folder. [Not sure where tribes is installed?](how-to-install#launcher-doesnt-know-where-tribes-is-installed)

### Step 2

Download the latest version of the map and extract it to \Tribes\TribesGame\CookedPC\ replacing "RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3.upk".

## Troubleshooting
### Launcher doesn't know where Tribes is installed? 

Usually it's "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\Tribes\Binaries\Win32\TribesAscend.exe". If you aren't sure and installed the game via steam, follow this video to get the correct directory.

</video>

### I hear the inject sound, but nothing about my game changes
Microsoft Visual C++ redistributes must be installed, an easy all in one installer is [here](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/)
### I keep failing to join a server
Probably in the wrong game mode for that server, community servers are labelled OOTB or GOTY to show their game mode. Go back to the main menu and select Switch to OOTB or Switch to GOTY like this video.

### Can't join a server with a custom map
To play on a server hosting a custom map you only need the latest version of the map. Some of these you will have to contact the owner for. [Follow this section of the guide](how-to-install#playing-custom-maps-on-the-official-game) first.
