## Description 
Caves, who knew you could use them for capping? Yeah probably no entry caps, but atleast exits are interesting. Much less of a worry about a sniper with that much cover. You can move fast but getting over the hill is a bit of a hurdle. A lot of the terrain is far less forgiving. 

## Features
Caves!

## Restrictions
![Periculo Birdseye](/img/maps/periculo-birdseye.png)
This map is aimed primarily for organised play.
As competitive viability is important for this map, all assets and terrain shall be mirrored to avoid advantage for either side.

## Capping

The #1 HOF Australian player JackTheBlack has a [capping video available](https://youtu.be/izQGpW2qAc8).
