## Description 
Scale is brought up a bit with this one. It's a vertical change which allows for very fast speeds to be obtained with ease. Yes yes it's basically DX, but DX is great. Fast return routes and easy clusters? Chaos and pressure, I love it. Set in a sandy oasis type area.

## Features
Jump pad out the back, bouncible object inside the base!

## Restrictions
![Incidamus Birdseye](/img/maps/incidamus-birdseye.png)
This map is aimed primarily for organised play.
As competitive viability is important for this map, all assets and terrain shall be mirrored to avoid advantage for either side.
